Let's follow [Steve's Jujutsu Tutorial](https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial/).

Since git is its backend, you can use jj without convincing your team to use it too, which makes it even more worth the experiment.

```sh
brew install jj
```

Looks like this tutorial wants to make a Rust app. Let's do that then.

```sh
brew install rustup # and note the PATH update
rustup default stable
```

Just because jj uses git storage doesn't mean you can use git commands. There is no .git folder after `jj git init` here, only a .jj folder.

- `jj st` or `jj status`: git status

There's no index/stage.

> This is a running theme with jj: it gives you fewer tools, but those tools end up having equivalent or even more power than their git counterparts. Because there are fewer tools, there's also less to learn.

Commit hashes are hexadecimal like git. Change IDs distinctly use the end of the alphabet.

- `jj desc` or `jj describe`: Sets a commit message, but doesn't commit yet.

Describing the current commit doesn't affect its hash or change ID.

Adding a file changes the commit hash. Removing it changes it again, but does not change it back to what it was. Neither of these working copy changes affected the change ID.

- `jj new`: Begins a new blank change, leaving the last committed.

After that, jj st now reports no changes, the working copy's description is blank, and the parent is the one we described a moment ago.

I noticed that if you create a file and check jj st, then .gitignore it and check again, it won't be immediately omitted. If I do both changes before running jj st, it will be ignored.

- `jj log`: git log

`@` means the working copy. Not the same as git's HEAD.

> why _should_ you have to create a commit message at the time of creating a commit, and not whenever you feel like it? The same stuff exists, but in more flexible pieces that I can combine together.

- `jj squash` or `jj amend`: Add working copy changes into the parent change. It keeps the change ID but replaces the commit hash.

Wow how do I keep reaching for the thing that comes next in the tutorial before it's introduced?

- `jj squash -i`: TUI for squashing particular changes into the parent.

In the interactive squash UI, space toggles selection and f unfolds a file to show individual changes. They are a tree. q quits, and confirming that aborts.

- `jj abandon`: Throws out all changes in the working copy. A new empty change ID is created.

Squashing defaults to moving changes from the working copy @ to its parent @-, but can be set go from any change to its parent with -r, or from any change to any other change with --from/-f and --into/-t, each of which default to @. So to edit a few changes ago you can just make the change and then jj squash -t thatchange. I bet you can just add -i if you need it piecewise.

> jj squash is more powerful than git add because it can work on any change and its parent, moving stuff between themâ€¦ Simpler, but more powerful, thanks to orthogonality.
